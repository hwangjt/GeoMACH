GeoMACH (Geometry-centric MDAO of Aircraft Configurations with High fidelity) is an aircraft 
design tool suite featuring parametric modelers for the geometry and structure of the aircraft 
that are efficient and supply derivatives with respect to all parameters, enabling optimization 
with large numbers of design variables.
